# FlaskTemplates

The purpose of this project, is to bring a collection of examples and templates, in order to provide a reference for those who are getting started or those who are constantly building Back-end services, applications, etc., using Flask as web framework. 
This project right now, has few examples/template, but very soon, it'll provide a collection of dozens of them.

Here the examples/templates that are available:

* cookies
* dynamic_form_fields
* get_post
* log_to_file
* log_to_file_with_rotate_and_stdout
* query_strings
* redirect_to_dynamic_url
* redirect_to_url
* render_html_template
* sqlite_connector

For any questions, I'm here :).

Thank You.
