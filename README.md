# FlaskTemplates

The purpose of this project, is to bring a collection of examples and templates, in order to provide a reference for those who are getting started or those who are constantly building Back-end services, applications, etc., using Flask as web framework. 
This project right, has few examples/template, but very soon, it'll provide a collection of dozens of them.

For any questions, I'm here :).

Thank You.
